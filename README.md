# Classical-E_and_M_Sim

This is a project I've been thinking of since high school E&M. I'm glad I finally got it done. Even though using SciPy's diff eq solver would've been faster, I had a lot of fun working on the differential equation solver used here. I proud of creating the algorithm to detect collisions on my own, which is quite computationally cheap only involving 2 subtraction of vectors and two dot product, totalling to 12 additions and 6 multiplications. I note that it only works well for point particles, but given that point particles are the main object in the simulation, I believe it's the best solution in this case. The model is fairly accurate, if a little slow since it's written in Python. This works as a nice proof of concept, but if I had to do a project like this again, I would choose a language like Rust or C++ to do most of the heavy computation and leave the graphing in Python.
